# Thesis Project Overview

This repository contains my master‚Äôs thesis, which demonstrates the application of the **Research Processes Curation Metamodel (RPCM)**, a model designed to represent the complete lifecycle of data-driven projects. 

RPCM is a conceptual and operational metamodel that integrates technical artifacts (data, code, models, results) with organizational elements (users, roles, decisions, and consensus). Its objective is to enable the complete curation, traceability, and reproducibility of data-driven projects. The pipeline implemented in this [repository](/rpcm-pipeline/) operationalizes RPCM, automatically transforming project metadata into model entities and tracing the entire experimental cycle, from data acquisition to results validation.

## Demo

If you would like to explore the pipeline implemented, you can access the Streamlit app here: https://rpcm-demo-pipeline.streamlit.app/

## How to execute

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

The environment is built with **Docker** using an **Apache Atlas** container.  
The folder [rpcm-atlas](./rpcm-atlas) includes an `atlas.yml` file that defines the Atlas image and mounts volumes with three JSON files:  

- `Entitydefs.json`: Json that contains RPCM entities definitions ready for ingestion into Atlas.  
- `graffiti_project.json`: A JSON file containing RPCM instances of entities derived from the real use case.
- `entities-bulk-atlas.json`: The output of the pipeline that consists of Kaggle metadta represented in RPCM.

### Start Atlas

Pull and start the Atlas container:

```bash
docker-compose -f atlas.yml pull
docker-compose -f atlas.yml up atlas
```
‚úÖ Check that the container is running
```bash
docker ps
```
üîë Access the container
```bash
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
apt update && apt install -y curl
```

üì• Ingesting Entities into Atlas
1. RPCM Entity Definitions
```
curl -u admin:admin -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @/tmp/Entitydefs.json \
http://localhost:21000/api/atlas/v2/types/typedefs
```
2. Use Case Instances (Graffiti Project)
```bash
curl -u admin:admin -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @/tmp/graffiti_project.json \
http://localhost:21000/api/atlas/v2/entity/bulk
```
3. Pipeline Results (Kaggle Projects)
```bash
curl -u admin:admin -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d @/tmp/entities-bulk-atlas.json \
http://localhost:21000/api/atlas/v2/entity/bulk
```
